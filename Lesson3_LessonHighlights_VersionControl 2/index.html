            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was created in 2005. The goals of creating Git were to enhance speed, have simple design, have strong support for non linear development, be fully distributed, and be able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently. Since then, Git has been able to accomplish all of these goals and retain these initial qualities which is why so many companies use Git now. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To start off with, Git is different from any other VCS so it is best to learn it with a clear mindset and unliked other VCS's, Git thinks about it data more like a stream of snapshots. This is an important aspect between Git and other VCS's because it makes Git reconsider almost every aspect of version control and makes Git more like a mini filesystem. Also, in Git it mostly only needs local files and resources to operate so you do not need any other information from another computer on your network. Furthermore, has high integrity. For instance, everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred by that checksum. Finally, Git generally only adds data and it has three states: committed, modified, and staged that your files can reside in.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. VCS is important because it allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when and more. Also, when you use VCS and you screw up a file or lose a files, you can easily recover it. Furthermore, their are differnt types of Version Control Systems such as local, centralized, and distributed.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control Systems were developed so that people could collaborate with developers on other systems. In this CVS, there is a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out the files from that central place. This setup of version control offers advantages and even disadvantages. An advantage is administrators have control over who can do what and its way easier to administer a CVCS. However, a disadvantage is that if the server is down at any time for any period of time, then no one can get on the server at all. Alos, there is a risk to losing everything if the data base becomes corrupted. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In distributed version control systems clinets just don't check out the latest snapshot of the file; they fully mirror the respository. Therefore, if any of the servers die and multiple systems were working with it, then any of the other client respositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every server or clone is a full backup of the data. Also, another benfit of using a distributed version control system is that these systems deal well with with having multiple remote respositories they can work with so you can be able to work with different groups of people in different ways at the same time within the same project.  </p>
